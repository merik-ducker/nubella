# Nubella

## Introduction

Nubella is an engaging React application that showcases the playful dynamics of balloons floating across the screen, powered by the physics engine Matter.js. This project offers users an interactive experience, allowing them to release balloons into the viewport and observe as they bounce and float in a realistic manner.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of the project here: [Nubella Live Demo](https://nubella-chi.vercel.app/)

## Features

- **Dynamic Balloon Simulation**: Enjoy the lifelike physics of balloons as they float, bounce, and interact with the boundaries of the screen.
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can interact with the simulation by shooting balloons into the viewport.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have installed the following tools:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://yourrepository.com/nubelle.git
   cd nubelle
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or if you prefer yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   or with yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Visit `http://localhost:4000` in your browser to view the application.

## Usage

 Once the application is running, click on the "Shoot Balloons" button to release balloons into the viewport. Watch as the balloons float up, bounce off the walls, and interact with each other in a colorful display.

## Technologies

This project is built using several key technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Matter.js**: A 2D physics engine for the web.
- **Vite**: A modern frontend build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience.
